Some time ago I got an interesting offer in the LinkedIn community to participate in **IT Hackathon organized for kids aged of 8-16** ([Event Link](https://lnkd.in/dfwHVwDY)). I was invited to be one of the Python’s jury. That was my first experience as a jury, and actually, the responsibilities were pretty clear for me, nothing special at first look. As a jury, we should have made code reviews, given constructive feedback, and chosen the winner. Sounds pretty straightforward, does it? 🤔🤫

But I changed my mind once those kids started presenting their jobs. It was not just a simple presentation made by one person. They all worked in Scrum and the responsibilities were divided/shared between members of the team. Each team had QA, Developers, and PO. Each member of the group presented his results. And at this moment you could imagine my feelings when the child at the age of 8 was presenting his part in a really efficient way as we can usually see in our regular jobs at Sprint Review sessions.

The tricky part was to rate their jobs because it was really hard to be fair as I just wouldn’t expect kids at such age to be so experienced and skillful, and not only in the meaning of technical skills. But they also showed great soft skills, like how to deal with stress or present work for people without a technical background.

Unfortunately, there was one team that didn’t finish the project in time and showed us only one part of it. The reason why they didn’t finish it is the war which unfortunately is continuing in Ukraine. There are not enough words in the world to describe my feelings when the 8 years old child said the phrase – “We are so sorry, but we couldn’t finish the project, because there was no light in our city for the last 2 days”. I find it unfair or even scary when a really small child is already aware of that horrible word – “War”... 🇺🇦 🤍

It was a pleasure for me to be there, great atmosphere, unforgettable experience and, what is more important, the great people - or I would say teenagers, which are the most important part of our future!
