I’m writing this post in order to say thanks to **STXNext** for the initiative to organize a workshop called – **“Frontend for Backend developers”**. Two days of intensive work were done and I think an impact won't long incoming.

Special thanks to [Tomasz Nowakowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasz-nowakowski-7146ab89/) for the warm welcome and a great time spent together.

The way of organizing your presentations/talks was really great. You gave us a high-level overview of frontend and which stack of frameworks is usually used to build web applications. The focus was placed on the real cases and how to resolve them, not just poor syntax and theory! Moreover, it was a great chance to see people in real life, not online in that constantly growing, digital world :D
It was the first time I have been to Poznan, and what I could say is the main office of STXNext looks dignified for being most likely the **largest Python Software house in the world!**
