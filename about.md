## History before I became a programmer
I began my career in trading company as a [Trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)) - <em>Work with a real, big money it's always stressful.<em>

But to be honest I really glad and proud that I was a part of [Cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) community.
The idea to become a trader came to me, exactly when I was working as a trader. At some point I realized that I stoped in development
and my daily routine turned into execution of instructions. And the most important thing, is that you success depends more on the volatility of the market, not on your knowledge! The first idea to change field of activity became to my mind when I tried to develop my first <em>**trading bot**.

## What I do as a programmer

Day by day I responsible for for <ins>**coding**</ins>, <ins>**designing**</ins>, <ins>**deploying**</ins>, and <ins>**debugging**</ins> development projects, typically on the server-side (or back-end) using [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system. As a [Python Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) I am often work in close collaboration with data collection and analytics to create useful answers to questions and provide valuable insight. Also I closely work with [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to build a true [RESTful API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) to creatig scalable code.
Moreover I familiar with optimisation and designing a productive architecture for various [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) DataBases.
I am practising usage [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in my development process. I consider writing tests of each implemented part of code is the best practices.

In all projects was used [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) methodology, personally I believe that is more than a collection of software development techniques or ceremonies. For me, Agile is a group of methodologies teams can mix as they like – as long as they stay committed to short feedback cycles and continuous improvement of their process.

I have an expirience working in a project where a lot of features such as:  [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)),  [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD),  [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch),  [Sentry](https://sentry.io/about/),  [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_(disambiguation))

## Currentry working in a two projects:

 - For one of the biggest [WEB application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) for multiple and multiplatform device managment
 - Application for fully control and management for small and medium-sized enterprises
