## History before I became a programmer
I began my career with a trading company as a [Trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)) - <em>Working with a real, big money it's always stressful.<em>

But to be honest I'm really glad and proud that I was a part of the [Cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) community.
The idea to become a programmer came to mind, while I was working as a trader. At some point I realized that I had stopped in developing as my daily routine had turned into the execution of instructions. Above all, the most important thing, is that success depended more on the volatility of the market, not on your knowledge! The first idea to change my field of activity came to my mind when I was trying to develop my first <em>**trading bot**.

## What I do as a programmer

On a day-to-day basis, I am responsible for for <ins>**coding**</ins>, <ins>**designing**</ins>, <ins>**deploying**</ins>, and <ins>**debugging**</ins> development projects, typically on the server-side (or back-end) using the [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system. As a [Python Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) I am often work in close collaboration with data collection and analytics to create useful answers to questions and provide a valuable insight. I also closely work with [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to build a true [RESTful API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) for creating scalable code.
Moreover I familiar with optimization and designing a productive architecture for various [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) DataBases.
Additionally, I practice [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) usage in my development process. I believe that writing tests of each implemented part of code is the best practice.

I have used [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) methodology in all projects and personally I believe that it is more than a collection of software development techniques or ceremonies. For me, Agile is a group of methodological teams that can mix as they like ‚Äì as long as they stay committed to short feedback cycles and continuous improvement of their process.

I also have an experience working on a project where a lot of features such as:  [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)),  [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD),  [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch),  [Sentry](https://sentry.io/about/) and [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_(disambiguation)) were used.

## Currentry working in a two projects:

 - For one of the biggest [WEB application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) for multiple and multiplatform device management
 - Application for full control and management for small and medium-sized enterprises
