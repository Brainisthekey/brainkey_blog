## History before I became a programmer 👨‍💻
I began my career with a trading company as a [Trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)) - <em>Working with a real, big money it's always stressful.<em>

But to be honest I'm really glad and proud that I was a part of the cryptocurrency community.
The idea to become a programmer came to my mind, while I was working as a trader. At some point I realized that I had stopped in developing as my daily routine had turned into the execution of instructions. Above all, the most important thing, is that success depended more on the volatility of the market, not on your knowledge! The first idea to change my field of activity came to my mind when I was trying to develop my first <em>**trading bot**.

## What I do as a programmer 💻

On a day-to-day basis, I am responsible for for <ins>**coding**</ins>, <ins>**designing**</ins>, <ins>**deploying**</ins>, <ins>**refactoring**</ins> and <ins>**debugging**</ins> development projects, typically on the server-side (or back-end) using the version control systems. As a Software Engineer I am often work in close collaboration with data collection and analytics to create useful answers to questions and provide a valuable insight. I also closely work with Django Rest Framework to build a true RESTful API and create a scalable code.
Moreover I familiar with optimization and designing a productive architecture for various SQL databases.
Additionally, I practice TDD in my development process. I believe that writing the tests of each implemented part of code is the best practice.

I have used Agile methodology in all projects and personally I believe that it is more than a collection of software development techniques or ceremonies. For me, Agile is a group of methodological teams that can mix as they like – as long as they stay committed to short feedback cycles and continuous improvement of their process.
